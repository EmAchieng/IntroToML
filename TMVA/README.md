Introduction to Machine Learning Tutorial - ROOT TMVA example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains the ROOT Macros for BDT training using the standard TMVA example data
that is automatically downloaded.

There is also an example setup for the Kaggle Higgs Challenge.

  TMVAClassification.C              - Train a BDT to discriminate between signal and background
                                      using the standard TMVA example as a starting point.
  Compare.C                         - Compare results from different trainings.
  TMVAClassificationApplication.C   - Macro that will run over data and append the value of the 
                                      trained BDT to a tuple.
  Htautau.C                         - Kaggle Higgs Challenge.

For more information see the corresponding pdf file containing information about the tutorial.
